I found this article particularly interesting because even large tech CEOs like Elon Musk could face catastrophic financial losses. I think the Twitter acquisition story is a milestone in the business world. Elon Musk is over-leveraged and has lost a lot of money so far in this deal. Will he recover and save Twitter by making it the virtual town square as he promised? Or would he simply fail and become another story of how the mighty have fallen? Nonetheless, I am entirely invested in this story and constantly wonder if there is some strange catch to Elon Musk's advocacy for free speech or if he might have had a few too many beers when he decided to offer to buy Twitter significantly more than market value at 42.5 dollars a share.
